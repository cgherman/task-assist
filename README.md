# TaskAssist

This alpha/demo project leverages the Google OAuth2 API and the Google Tasks API.This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Features/Usage

### The Eisenhower Matrix

This app is currently in read-only mode.  This intent is to create a simple drag-and-drop app that allows people rearrange their priorities using an "Eisenhower Matrix".

### Logging in

This app does not have any remote data servers, and no task information is collected.  After logging in with your Google account, the UI interacts directly with Google services.

### Adding Tasks

You must have a Google Task List set up to use this app.  Tasks must be added via the various apps that Google provides.  Links to those UIs are available in the menu of this app.
